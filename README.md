# [Bot Takeover Random Weaponry]
## About
When this plugin is running on your server, the player will be given a random set of weapons whenever he is taking over a bot. Players will be given one primary weapon, and a secondary weapon, along with a knife. But these weapons are only given to the player if he is currently not in possession of any weapons right after taking over the bot.
This fixes a common problem some Warcraft-Source servers face, where players would take over a bot, but the bot just so happens to play a knife only race, leaving the player who took over the bot to fend for himself only using a knife, regardless of whether the player is a knife only race or not himeslf.
